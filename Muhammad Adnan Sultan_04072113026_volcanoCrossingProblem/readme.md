# Volcano Crossing Value Iteration and Policy Iteration

This project implements value iteration and policy iteration algorithms to solve the volcano crossing example. The goal is to find the optimal path to cross the volcano safely by maximizing the total reward. The project also includes a visualization of how the values change after every iteration of the algorithms.

## Project Structure
